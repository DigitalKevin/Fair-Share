## Fair-Share
Fair Share is a simple group expense splitting app.  Example use: camping trip, friends night out, travel, groceries, roommate expenses. Everyone can log what they paid (gas, food, supplies etc.) and Fair Share will compute how much each person owes or should get back.

Help small groups settle expenses without arguments or confusion — using basic addition/subtraction/division.

- Add expenses (Who paid, amount, description)
- Calculate total cost
- Calculate fair share cost per person
- Show results: who owes money / who should be paid

## Future (Phase 2/3)
- Optimize who pays who to minimize total number of transactions
- mobile app version
- exporting results
